### Description

This code is an activex control button and text animation. I use HTML button and marquee. I use HTML button because in HTML you can make many kinds of good looking button very easy, combine with my knowledge in VB I intergate the two. At first I thought it was impossible but I did it.

The only little problem with this is that, it is a bit slow while loading. But if everything is aready loaded, it will run very smooth.

If you DO NOT like my work please DO NOT vote for me.

Thanks...
